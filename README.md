## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the estimated price of a house using important features such as:

- Overall Quality
- Living Area
- Garage Capacity
- Garage Area
- Basement Area
- 1st Floor Area
- Number of Bathrooms
- Total Rooms
- Year Built
- Year Remodeled

The model was trained on the Ames Housing Dataset and deployed using Streamlit Cloud.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis
- Feature importance investigation
- Dataset understanding

### 4. Feature Engineering
Selected the most relevant features:

- OverallQual
- GrLivArea
- GarageCars
- GarageArea
- TotalBsmtSF
- 1stFlrSF
- FullBath
- TotRmsAbvGrd
- YearBuilt
- YearRemodAdd

### 5. Model Training
Models tested:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

Final model selected:

✅ Random Forest Regressor

### 6. Model Evaluation

Model Performance:

- Training R² Score: ~0.91
- Test R² Score: ~0.88

This indicates good predictive performance with controlled overfitting.

### 7. Deployment

- Model saved using Joblib
